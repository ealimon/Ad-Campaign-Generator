A simple demo web app that generates Google Ads assets (20 headlines, 10 descriptions, 10 callouts, structured snippets, and sitelinks) using the Google Generative Language API. Enter law firm name, landing page URL and ad group name, set your API key (stored only in memory), then generate and export ad copy to CSV. Note: do not hardcode API keys in client-side code for production â€” use a server-side proxy.
